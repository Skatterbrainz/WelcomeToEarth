# Disclaimers and Introduction

This book is a collection of possible future events wherein visitors to Earth encounter Earthlings for the first time in a public situation. It is intended to be sattirical and fun in nature. It is not intended to be offensive or threatening to anyone or any group. Humor is the only goal. Because, humans are humorous. Just ask any dog.

That said: The way this works is I, Baron von Skatterbrainz, reserve the right to accept or refuse any contributions if they contain excessively offensive or derogatory terms or links to offensive, derogatory or threatening content. What does this mean in legal terms? I don't know. I'm not an attorney.

I just want this to be a place to have some fun with a simple story and see how your contributions can make the rest of us laugh; and find some enjoyment in an otherwise dismal plot.

Please keep expletives to a minimum, if you absolutely cannot avoid them.

Please do not use derogatory terms to refer to any group(s).

I'd like to keep this PG or PG13, whatever those translate to nowadays.
