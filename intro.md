# Disclaimers and Introduction

This book is a collection of possible future events wherein visitors to Earth encounter Earthlings for the first time in a public situation. It is intended to be sattirical and fun in nature. It is not intended to be offensive or threatening to anyone or any group. Humor is the only goal. Because, humans are humorous. Just ask any dog.

All pages are written in standard [Markdown](https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-introduction/) language. If you're not familiar with markdown, start [here](https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-introduction/).

That said: The way this works is I have to review and approve (or reject) any contributions to this "book". If they're accepted, you get to brag about it to people who have no idea or interest whatsoever about this or anything related to GitHub or aliens. If it gets rejected, it's most likely going to be due to excessively offensive or derogatory terms or links to offensive, derogatory or threatening content, or just wandering into a drainage ditch with no end in sight. What does this mean in legal terms? I don't know. I'm not an attorney. I'm not a writer either. Most real writers (authors, cough cough) would probably be incredibly offended at this anyway.

I just want this to be a place to have some fun with a simple story and see how your contributions can make the rest of us laugh; and find some enjoyment in an otherwise dismal plot.

Please keep expletives to a minimum, if you absolutely cannot avoid them.

Please do not use derogatory terms to refer to any group(s).

I'd like to keep this PG or PG13, whatever those translate to nowadays.

Now, add a chapter and have some fun!
