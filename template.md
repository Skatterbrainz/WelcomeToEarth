# Chapter X - ____ Visit

by YOUR_NAME_HERE

It was a ____, ____ Tuesday in ____, in early May, which is typical for most days in the ____. But unlike mid-Summer, it wasn't a ____ day either. There were only a few puffy white clouds scattered across the vast blue field above. Which any of them could turn into a super cell and spawn deadly tornados in the blink of an eye.

Then a strange glow formed in one part of the sky. It was white at first, then dark gray, and soon the tornado sirens began firing up in the distance. But then it lightened up again and turned yellowish, then firey orange and red, with sparks of white trailing out from around the outer edges.

Suddenly, a smooth metallic object appeared from the center of the glow, with a ring of smoke not far behind. Much like the smoke rings a cigarette smoker might create, to impress their friends or someone on a date.

The object, gleaming with a skin of mirror-like silver, looked more like a blob of mercury than a hard object.

As it neared the ____ surface a mile off of the nearest ____, it pushed up an enormous cloud of dust and debris in all directions. Eventually, the fog dissipated. THe object was motionless, as if it had landed on legs, but it had no legs or visible support of any kind. It was levetating completely still.

A hatch opened beneath, and three creatures floated out slowly in a sequential fashion. The crowds began forming along the ____, some leaning out through their ____, some standing beside their ____. Others climbed atop the ____, or just wandered out into the ____, not caring about bumping into a ____.

The three visitors floated up to within a few meters of the crowd.

One of the visitors, _____

It was at that very exact moment, that the ____, and most of the nearby crowd, realized that ____ was considered an ____.

So, the visitors vaporized all of them, and then vaporized the entire planet.
