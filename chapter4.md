Chapter 4 - The Awkward Visit

by [Skatterbrainz](/Skatterbrainz/WelcomeToEarth/)

It was a steamy-hot Tuesday in August, which is typical for most days in the Kansas plains. But unlike Autumn, it wasn't a tornado day either. There were only a few puffy white clouds scattered across the vast blue field above.

Then a strange glow formed in one part of the sky. It was white at first, then dark gray. But then it lightened up again and turned yellowish, then firey orange and red, with sparks of white trailing out from around the outer edges.

Suddenly, a smooth metallic object appeared from the center of the glow, with a ring of smoke not far behind. Much like the smoke rings a cigarette smoker might create, to impress their friends or someone on a date.

The object, gleaming with a skin of mirror-like silver, looked more like a blob of mercury than a hard object.

As it neared the surface of endless fields of wheat, about a mile off of the nearest road, it pushed up an enormous cloud of dust and debris in all directions. Eventually, the fog dissipated. THe object was motionless, as if it had landed on legs, but it had no legs or visible support of any kind. It was levetating completely still.

A hatch opened beneath, and three creatures floated out slowly in a sequential fashion. The crowds began forming along the road and nearby farms. Some spectators leaning out through their combines, some standing beside their tractors and trucks. Others climbed atop the bails of hay, or just wandered out into the wheat fields, not caring about bumping into a jackrabbit.

The three visitors floated up to within a few meters of the crowd.

One of the visitors, Jim, walked out first. As he approached, he was starting to make out their faces more clearly. Within a few seconds, he realized that each of the visitors had what appeared to be a face like a human buttocks, with a mouth that was identical to a rectum.

"Howdy!" he shouted
"Pfffftt! Pppfpfffpfppfffft! Thftpt tfffffpttt!" they replied, sounded exactly like farting.

Jim couldn't help but laugh.

It was at that very exact moment, that Jim, and all of the spectators within range, realized that they were extremely offended.

So, the visitors vaporized all of them, and then vaporized the entire planet.

The End
