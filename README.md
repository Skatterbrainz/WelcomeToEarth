# Welcome To Earth

## An Open Source Book

Built today for people in the future, which will someday be today.

### Overview

The goal of this book, or project, is to have a little fun with different possible ways humans could unintentionally trigger future alien visitors into destroying us all. Feel free to clone the ["template"](./template.md) to add your own chapters.

Makes a great gift. Batteries not included.

The names and places have been changed to protect the future.

### How Does This Work?

It doesn't. There's no _work_ being done here. It's all play. Start with the [Disclaimers](./intro.md) page to learn what this is all about. After that, read [Chapter 1](./chapter1.md) to see an example. Then, grab a copy of the [Disclaimers](./template.md) and fill it in to make your own chapter (or three).

Thank you!
