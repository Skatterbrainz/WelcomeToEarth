# Chapter 3 - Another First Visit

It was a clear, sunny Tuesday in Seattle, in early May, which is typical for most days in the northwest American state. But unlike mid-Summer, it wasn't a melting-hot 70 F day either. There were only a few puffy white clouds scattered across the vast blue field above. Wait. Who are we trying to fool here? It's Seattle in May, so the only blue things in the sky are Delta flights leaving SEA on their way to places where the sun can be seen.

Then a strange glow formed in one part of the sky. It was white at first, then dark gray, then a darker gray, almost as dark as the normal dark gray that covers most of the Puget Sound outside of the months of June and July. But then it lightened up again and turned yellowish, then firey orange and red, with sparks of white trailing out from around the outer edges.

Suddenly, a smooth metallic object appeared from the center of the glow, with a ring of smoke not far behind. Much like the smoke rings a cigarette smoker might create, to impress their friends or someone on a date.

The object, gleaming with a skin of mirror-like silver, looked more like a blob of mercury than a hard object.

As it neared the rocky hillside surface a mile off of the nearest road, it pushed up an enormous cloud of dust and debris in all directions. Eventually, the fog dissipated. The object was motionless, as if it had landed on legs, but it had no legs or visible support of any kind. It was levetating completely still.

A hatch opened beneath, and three creatures floated out slowly in a sequential fashion. The crowds began forming along the roadway, some leaning out through their vehicle windows, some standing beside their vehicles. Others climbed atop the roofs or truck beds, or just wandered out into the scrub, not caring about bumping into a thorny cactus.

The three visitors floated up to within a few meters of the crowd.

One of the visitors, a teenage person, raised her, I mean "its" hands, and greeted them. One hand opened wide, palms facing the visitors. The other holding a vape and a venti Starbucks coffee cup, half-full of a soy latte with steamed almond milk. Because, in Seattle, in May, every container with 50 percent of a caffeinated liquid has to be identified as "half-full" as opposed to "half-empty", or it risks being ostrasized by the International Seasonal Affective Disorder Society, or ISADS for short.

It was at that very exact moment, that the teenager person, and most of the nearby crowd of humans, realized that raising inanimate objects overhead was considered an obscene and vulger threat.

So, the visitors vaporized all of them, and then vaporized the entire planet.

The End
