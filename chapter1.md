# Chapter 1 - The First Visit

It was a clear, sunny day in Arizona, which is typical for most days in the southwest state. There were only a few puffy white clouds scattered across the vast field of blue.

Then a strange glow formed in one part of the sky. It was white at first, then yellowis, then firey orange and red, with sparks of white trailing out from around the outer edges.

Suddenly, a smooth metallic object appeared from the center of the glow, with a ring of smoke not far behind. Much like the smoke rings a cigarette smoker might create, to impress their friends or 
someone on a date.
