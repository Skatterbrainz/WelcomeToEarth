# Chapter 1 - The First Visit

by Skatterbrainz

It was a clear, sunny Tuesday in Arizona, in early May, which is typical for most days in the southwest state. But unlike mid-Summer, it wasn't a melting-hot day either. There were only a few puffy white clouds scattered across the vast blue field above.

Then a strange glow formed in one part of the sky. It was white at first, then yellowis, then firey orange and red, with sparks of white trailing out from around the outer edges.

Suddenly, a smooth metallic object appeared from the center of the glow, with a ring of smoke not far behind. Much like the smoke rings a cigarette smoker might create, to impress their friends or someone on a date.

The object, gleaming with a skin of mirror-like silver, looked more like a blob of mercury than a hard object.

As it neared the desert surface a mile off of the nearest road, it pushed up an enormous cloud of dust and debris in all directions. Eventually, the fog dissipated. THe object was motionless, as if it had landed on legs, but it had no legs or visible support of any kind. It was levetating completely still.

A hatch opened beneath, and three creatures floated out slowly in a sequential fashion. The crowds began forming along the roadway, some leaning out through their vehicle windows, some standing beside their vehicles. Others climbed atop the roofs or truck beds, or just wandered out into the scrub, not caring about bumping into a thorny cactus.

The three visitors floated up to within a few meters of the crowd.

One of the visitors, a teenage girl, raised her hands and greeted them,

"Welcome to Earth!" followed by an ecstatic giggle, like normally heard at a music concert.

It was at that very exact moment, that the girl, and most of the nearby crowd, realized that those three words didn't translate into the language used by the visitors. What they didn't know at the time, was that it literally translated to the visitors as:

"We wish to kill and eat you all!"

But the crowd barely had time to allow their jaws to slacken, before the visitors vaporized all of them, and then vaporized the entire planet.

The End
